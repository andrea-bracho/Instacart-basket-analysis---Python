# Instacart grocery Basket Analysis :convenience_store:
### Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. My task is to discover sales patterns, derive insights, and suggest strategies for better segmentation.
## Key Questions:
#### 1. The sales team wants to know the busiest days of the week to schedule adds at times when there are fewest orders.
#### 2. At what particular times of the day do people spend the most money?
#### 3. Create and use a price range grouping to help the marketing and sales teams.
#### 4. Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders?
#### 5. Identify customers different ordering behaviors, based on brand loyalty, geographic region, age, family status...

### The final project is an Excel document (posted above) that includes all the details on how the data was received, cleaned, transformed, and the visualizations to answer the questions above.  
#### The data was merged using four datasets (orders, orders_products, products, and customers data)  obtained from this website: “The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”, Accessed from [https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017) on January 2022.
